                    <p>Some members of Congress are considering significant changes to Medicare that could have a devastating effect on millions of Americans. Proponents call these changes government “negotiation,” but what they are actually proposing is anything but that. These politicians want to repeal a key provision of the Medicare Part D program that protects robust coverage and access to medicines for seniors and people with disabilities.

                    Seniors and people with disabilities have robust access to medicines in Medicare Part D due in large part to a protection known as the “noninterference clause.” The noninterference clause prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering in the private negotiations – which already occur in Medicare Part D – between pharmaceutical manufacturers and Part D insurance plans or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).</p>
